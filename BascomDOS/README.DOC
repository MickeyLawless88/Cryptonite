For MS-DOS

Release 5.36 Update Notice
April 24, 1984


The following correction was made over version 5.35:

* PROBLEM: When a file was OPENed in APPEND mode, the end-
of-file mark was correctly found.  However, if the end-of-
file mark appeared in a partially filled block, all data in
that block, prior to the end-of-file mark, was cleared.

* SOLUTION: When the end-of-file mark is found, the data
prior to the mark is kept intact and the new data is
appended at the end-of-file mark.
